Required Modules:

vuser requires the following Perl modules that are not included with Perl:
- Config::IniFiles
- Regexp::Common

Other vuser extensions may require other Perl modules. Please see the
documentation included with those extensions for additional requirements.

Basic Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

That will install vuser on your system in /usr (or /usr/local) by default.
You can define a different install path by setting PREFIX when running
Makefile.PL. For example, to install vuser in your home directory

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

or to install in /opt

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt

The install script will create lib, share and sbin directories in PREFIX.
